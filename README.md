Hardware used: 
microcontroller board [Adafruit M4 CAN ](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4759), should also work with Adafruit STM32F4 board and a CAN Transceiver. 
lamp: Supernova M99 Pro with Higo 6 pin cable connector.


Test-script code.py

Just transfer the files over a CircuitPython flashed Adafruit M4 CAN Express board and modify the script to your needs.



This will eventually become a proper controller for the m99 pro, based on digital input buttons, just so it will fit my needs for my custom ebike build.
Right now it's just a proof of concept (i.e. it can control an m99 pro, CANOpen Variant)
Use it as you wish.
